/**
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/23">Year 2017, day 23</a>. This is another assembly code simulator,
 * similar to day 18. The instructions are a bit simpler, however. Part one asks how many times the virtual machine
 * executes a multiply instruction, while part two flips an input bit and asks for the value of a register when the
 * program completes. The caveat here is the program is extremely inefficient and will not finish in any reasonable
 * amount of time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The key to part two is figuring out the algorithm and coming up with a better version. Manipulating it by hand, I
 * translated it into pseudocode. From here I simplified variables. For example, register g is only ever used to do math
 * to compare expressions to zero in a JNZ instruction. This means g can be elided into expressions used in conditional
 * statements. Next, I found that registers b and c were used as lower and upper bounds for a loop. As I simplified and
 * restructured, these variables actually survived to the final iteration and initialize with values pulled directly
 * from the program input.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From here, I worked from inner to outer loops to determine that the algorithm is a very simple primality check. It
 * actually counts composite numbers between b and c but does so in the most naive way possible: dividing by every
 * single number between two and the number. Zero optimizations. This is why the program will not complete in a
 * reasonable amount of time. Instead, sieve enough prime numbers for the algorithm and perform a binary search on each
 * number to test its primality. Testing thousands of numbers in part two takes more time than testing a few tens of
 * numbers in part one using the less efficient algorithm, even with the (admittedly, low) overhead of the sieve.
